Branching in Git
It refers to breakdown the project and maintain the flow of projectv by working parallely and
then assemble it in the final node(master branch) 
git branch
the above gets used for  checking at which branch currently the user is

now if not any branch gets created then defaulty it is master branch
if  it wants to  breakdown the work and want to do operation in another branch and then merge after getting completed then for creating the branch it can use git switch command
git switch -c <branch-name> 
in this -c stands for create
git checkout -b <branch-name>
this is used for creating a new branch and switching to it at the same time
